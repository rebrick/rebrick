Rebrick
=======

This main repository contains the information, general issues, as well as
documentation.

## Why Rebrick
This org was created to quickly test features on virtual Redbrick - away from
actual Redbrick so that nobody can be hurt.  

## Origins
This is a follow-up and implementation of the original `rb2.0` proposal, which
unfortunally never actually was implemented. Nobody says that anything from this
be implemented back in to actual Redbrick, but its worth a shot.

## Contributing
Just make a PR. This is Experimental code. If you have an idea, use the Issues
on this repo.
